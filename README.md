# INIDESAKU

Starting from an understanding of the Smart City concept which can be applied in the context of village development, the concept of Smart Village or Smart Village emerged. 
The aim of this implementation is to improve the quality of life of village residents and advance economic productivity by utilizing technology and data. 
Therefore, a technological system is needed that can improve services, manage village farmer groups, empower Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), provide regional-related information, and support other economic sectors.
Inidesaku is present as an application designed to support the achievement of these goals by providing powerful technological solutions. 
The goal of the Inidesaku application project is to update the user interface and provide users with a more comfortable and engaging experience. 
Design and navigation improvements aim to make it easier for users to explore application features.
This project is based on the concept of rejuvenation using the Kotlin programming language and implementing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. 
This architectural change not only improves application performance, but also makes it more secure in data storage and management. 
With a primary focus on improving the user experience, this project is committed to improving the interface through Kotlin's advantages in modularity and superior performance. 
The use of the MVVM architecture is also a focus to provide a clearer and more efficient structure for future development. 
By incorporating MVVM architecture, applications now have a clear separation between business logic, views, and data storage components. 
This not only improves code readability, but also makes it easier to test and maintain. 
Implementing MVVM provides an additional layer of more secure data management. 
With a clear separation between Model, View, and ViewModel, the risk of errors in data manipulation can be reduced.
